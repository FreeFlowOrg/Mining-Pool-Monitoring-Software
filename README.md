# Mining Pool Monitoring Software

MPMS or Mining Pool Monitoring Software is a software to read and save data of FreeFlo's mining pool for Litecoins.
Here, we just make sure to collect data at an interval of 30 mins to help us with future predictions.<br/>
The project has currently been hosted on a local machine and will soon be deployed to a server.<br/>

This is a project that might be case specific. In this case, it's specific to what we need. The mining pool has been created through miningrigrentals.<br/>

So, incase you're pool also exists on that platform and also your pool deals with mining of Litecoins, then you can freely use this software.

## The development environment required for this project will soon be updated.
